                        Makuta Robert is an old school web developer who realised it was time to change, assuming that it is not possible to live in the modern world with old methods and mentality, he started reviewing his programming skills, thanks to a challenge from one of his customers he looked for a better solution in the market as he were obsessed to develop application using PHP codes, he started by descovering some frameworks such as CakePHP, Yii Framework, Laravel among others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After a trial of these various frameworks, Robert decided to move with Laravel framework due to its dynamism and its growing support community. Laravel is really amazing! But due to the increasing demand in the market that requires speed and efficiency as wel as smartness in the appearance, Robert MAKUTA moved on again, and looked for the available CMS based on Laravel. He found the pretty AsGuard which looked so good, but Robert found that OctoberCMS was more friendly and it looks to become the leader of CMS in the near future. Meanwhile another nice CMS, the pretty Microweber has been introduced for people without any coding background.
