                </header>
                <p>Dabani Coding is a dream project to develop in the future a new language based on the existing languages, but the dreamed language should be universal as its main feature is to be convertable in any existing language.</p>
                <p>The journey to create a new programing language looks impossible as it requires high rated skills and a good experience in programing; but knowing that the promoter of the project is a passionate person who never give up without attaining his goal, an open man who has a strong conviction and trust in workgroup, he hope to collaborate with various engineers around the globe.</p>                
                <p>Even though it may take some years of process, the dream project promoter has already started by learning some languages, the markup language HTML5 and the pretty CSS3 are the starting point, especially for the development of the friendly user interfaces. Certainly in the near future he will master the front end development after what he should strick with the backend development.</p>

            <section id="About_the_name" class="main-section">
                <header>
                    <h1>About the name</h1>
                </header>
                <p>Dabani is a name picked from a childhood ball game! Dabani is an extraordinary result proving a wonderfull ability of the player who matches two targets with two positive scores, in other words a double from only one trial play! I remember I have never realised a "Dabani" without making some calculations in my head, the distance, the angle and the force to put when pushing the ball.</p>
                <p>Dabani coding is a wonderfull dream project which will absolutely get a double result, a "<strong>dabani</strong>", first of all from the connected developers around the world and secondly it will solve some conflicts between various languages, like it aims to be a flexible and translatable language between any existing language!</p>

            <section id="About_the_Logo" class="main-section">
                <header>
                    <h1>About the Logo</h1>
                </header>
                <p>The logo is simply formed by two letters, the initials of words "dabani" and "coding". So, someone seeing these two letters should not be confused, as simple like that!</p>
                <p>Inside the letter <strong>d</strong> there is the famous symbol <strong><></strong> that is familiar to any people in the world of programing, the very known symbol of code! The dabani dream project will be realised only by writing and put together logically related codes! Keep coding everywhere and everytime will turn the impossible to possible!</p>

            <section id="About_the_colors" class="main-section">

                    <h1>About the colors</h1>
                </header>
                <p>The colors are choosen between green and white! Green is known as a symbol of prosperity, progress and growth, while is a symbol of clarity, cleanless!</p>
                <p>The green color is picked with variant teint from darkgreen to lightgreen! The dabani project start in darkness, the promoter doesn't have all the required skills, there is not yet any software engineer contributing to the project, but as long as it progress, it will gradually become clear! The project is starting too small, but surely it will grow and grow to become big, maybe the biggest project that has ever existed in the programing world!</p>

                    <h1>General Conclusion</h1>
                </header>
                <p>Dabani Coding is an audacious dream project that merit the attention and the contribution of everyone in the programing world! It will require to the promoter to not loose focus and to to be enough open to the contribution from other people.</p>
                <p>At the end of this project it will be no longer supremacy between programing languages, any programmer with any background should be interested in that project!</p>                
                <p>Various social media and any other exchange platform of scientists is the main tools to collect idea and to put together different foundings!</p>                
                <p>Below is a list of some usefull social media in sight:</p>
