                Makuta Robert is an old school web developer who realised it was time to change, assuming it is not possible to live in the modern world with old methods and mentality, he started reviewing his programming skills, thanks to a challenge from one of his customers he looked for a better solution in the market as he were obsessed to develop application using PHP codes, he started by descovering some frameworks such as CakePHP, Yii Framework, Laravel among others.
                </p>
                <p>
                After a trial of these various frameworks, Robert decided to move with Laravel framework due to its dynamism and its growing support community. Laravel is really amazing! But due to the increasing demand in the market that requires speed and efficiency as wel as smartness in the appearance, Robert MAKUTA moved on again, and looked for the available CMS based on Laravel. He found the pretty AsGuard which looked so good, but Robert found that OctoberCMS was more friendly and looks to be the leader. Meanwhile another nice CMS, the pretty Microweber has been introduced for people without any coding background.

                <p>
                Remember, MAKUTA Robert is a first of all a passionate programmer, with a strong desire to become a world class software engineer, he cannot be emprisonned by the facilities offered by these established frameworks and CMS, that is why in his mind he is convinced he has to work hard by mastering all of the web technologies starting by the User Interface design before he gets into the backend technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                Recently, MAKUTA Robert started a long process to enter the world of worldclass developers thanks to ANDELA program. Certifications from Free Code Camp is a very first step for the long journey that has already started, in a fiew years to come MAKUTA Robert hope to be wel skilled not only in web design, but also in mobile application, data science, artificial intelligency and many other Information Technology domains.
